# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **image steganography** to securely hide sensitive data within images. It enhances confidentiality by embedding encrypted data inside images using Python-based algorithms.  

## 🚀 Features
- **Secure Data Hiding:** Uses steganography techniques to conceal text in images.  
- **Encryption Support:** Encrypts data before embedding for added security.  
- **Minimal Image Distortion:** Ensures data is hidden without noticeable image quality loss.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Can be extended with a GUI for easy interaction.  
- **Custom Extraction Mechanism:** Retrieves hidden data only with the correct decryption key.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow (PIL)  
- **Encryption:** AES (if implemented)  
- **GUI (Optional):** Tkinter  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
